# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Installation Instructions
Follow these instructions to install the dependencies and set up the development environment:

1.Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) from https://nodejs.org/ if you haven't already.
Install React Native CLI globally using the command npm install -g react-native-cli (for React Native projects) or create-react-app (for React web projects) using npm install -g create-react-app.
2.Sign up for an account and obtain API keys for Tomorrow.io API from https://www.tomorrow.io/.
Update the API keys in the project configuration files.

### Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to implement a practical application that integrates with weather APIs to fetch and display real-time and forecasted weather data. This project will help you gain hands-on experience with React ,API integration, error handling, and user interface design.
